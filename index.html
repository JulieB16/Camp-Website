            This camp is run by Julie Belfor who has coached for the Cincinnati United Juniors Program. Combining her passion for soccer and community service, 
            Julie created this camp to provide a fun and inclusive environment for young players to build skills and confidence. 
            All proceeds go to Soccer Without Borders, a nonprofit organization that empowers underprivileged youth around the world 
            through the game of soccer.
